        <p class="copy">Carbon Footprint was founded in 2009. While riding a camel during a trip to the Indianapolis
          Zoo, ‘Atom’ Kern took a leap of faith and decided to start developing websites, focusing specifically on
          plants. He immediately hired 3 master coders/designers.</p>

        <p class="copy">One could say that we have an even larger Carbon Footprint in 2019 with 15 employees and
          over 3000 active clients.<br><br></p>

        <h3 class="subs">Some of our clients</h3>

            oxygen so we can have more carbon in the air.</li>
